I installed the following applications: 
1) finger 0.17-15
2) postgres 9.5
3)apache2 2.4.18
4) flask python-flask  0.10
5) python-sqlalchemy   1.0.11
6) python-psycopg2   2.6.1
7) libpq-dev  9.5
8) Flask-Dance 0.14
9) Flask-Limiter 1.0.1
10) Flask-HTTPAuth 3.2.4

I created a .conf file in in the Apache 'sites-enabled' directory.
I created a .wsgi file alongside my app directory.
I changed the database connection from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
Due to my use of Flask-Dance and the requirement for redirect url's, I needed to get a domain name to conform with Google's redirect url requirements.

I made generous use of Google, Stack Overflow, and my new mentor, Sarmad.
